This project was based of a sample YouTube video, I have begun to learn Ruby
on Rails and I find the best way to learn is to code along yourself and I have
fun doing it. Some of the code I have updated and toyed with myself to change
things and help develop my own understanding a little more.

The project was built using:
Ruby: ruby 2.3.3p222
Rails: Rails 5.0.1

To start the application its pretty simple just clone the repo and then
within your command line type bundle install. Of course you will need
bundle installed on your machine for this to work.

Then just navigate to localhost:3000 and start editing and toying with it
yourself. In the future I want to be able to develop these simple CRUD
applications myself but following tutorials can teach you a lot more than
just reading a webpage or book.
